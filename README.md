## Purpose
This repository is designed to organize and contain all my notes from listening to podcasts and similar content. Details for each podcast (such as the purpose, creator, presenter and other metadata) is contained in this readme, while each podcast will receive its own markdown file for notes.

Podcasts will be broken down by topic and linked to its related content. Any multimedia components will also be contained inside the note markdown files (including images, books, videos and bibliographic information).
