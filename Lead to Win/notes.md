## Episode 7 - The Surprising New Science of Achievement

    - Discomfort - we aren't sure but are compelled
    - Dillusion - beyond capacity and reason
  - We get a greater emotional reward when we have tough goals
- Competition
  - Sometimes the presence of competition is enough to motivate new techniques or added effort
  - Teams have different tolerances for risk, so leaders need to be aware and must indicate that success is actually possible
  - Competition also can breed respect for those who are performing better than you
- Community
  - Success requires help, and lots of it
  - Research suggests that sharing your goals selectively increases commitment
- Celebration
  - Celebrating can have big impacts in private (very motivating) and public (shows others the desired behaviors)
  - Set up a reward 
  - Measure the gain (from baseline) rather than the gap (from the initial goal)

## Episode 8 - You Can Design Your Own Year
- 5 steps to design your year
  - Choose the right approach
    - The Drift - go with the flow
      - Go with the flow is not the right approach as it leads to stagnation
      - You cannot choose the destination 
    - Driven - an overcorrection of the drift
      - Can lead to blowouts
      - Higher risk of losing those things that are important to you
    - The Drift and being Driven are two sides of the same coin
    - This is often the default mode
    - Design
      - Intentionally craft the life you really want
  - Set aside the time
    - Desirable outcomes rarely just happen
    - A couple hours is usually all that is needed for planning a year (spread over a couple days)
  - Chart a course
    - Where are you, and where do you want to go?
    - Acknowledge where you are
  - Envision your ideal outcome
  - Make the first step
    - A detailed plan can help, but procrastination destroys potential
    - Hold your goals tightly and your strategy lightly
